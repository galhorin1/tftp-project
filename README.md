# tftp-project
making tftp server and client,
using UDP as a way to transmit data ,
the single user files are meant for local env,
the dummydata file is a file you can download to your server/client folder to test sending and recieving file,
the other 2 files are for multiple users ( atm only 10 users/ports ) and for online(ip) server.

Please note the client and server are not in the same folder when running them because they both use the current working dir,
also check the separator varible and match it to your OS path separator
for any questions galhorin1@gmail.com
